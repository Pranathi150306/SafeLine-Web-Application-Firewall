"# SafeLine-Web-Application-Firewall" 
# 🛡️ SafeLine Web Application Firewall (WAF) Deployment Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of **SafeLine Web Application Firewall (WAF)** in a virtualized lab environment using **Ubuntu **, **Kali Linux**, **Docker**, and **Oracle VirtualBox**.

The objective of this project is to protect a web application hosted on Ubuntu from common web-based attacks such as:

* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

SafeLine WAF was positioned between the attacker and the target web application to inspect, filter, and block malicious HTTP requests.

---

## Project Objectives

* Deploy SafeLine WAF using Docker.
* Configure WAF protection rules.
* Host a web application on Ubuntu Server.
* Simulate attacks from Kali Linux.
* Detect and block SQL Injection attacks.
* Detect and block XSS attacks.
* Monitor and analyze security events.

docker --version
```

---

## Deploy SafeLine

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://waf.chaitin.com/release/latest/setup.sh)"
```

After installation:

```bash
docker ps
```

Access SafeLine Dashboard:

```text
http://SERVER_IP:9443
```

---

# Web Application Setup

Install Apache:

```bash
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

Verify:

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

Access:

```text
http://SERVER_IP
```

---

# WAF Configuration

# Security Testing

## SQL Injection Test

### Payload

```sql
' OR '1'='1
```

### Test Procedure

From Kali Linux:

```text
http://TARGET_IP/index.php?id=' OR '1'='1
```

### Result

✅ SafeLine detected and blocked the SQL Injection attempt.

## XSS Attack Test

### Payload

```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

### Test Procedure

Submit the payload through a vulnerable input field.

### Result

✅ SafeLine blocked the malicious script.
